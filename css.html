<h2 style="color:blue;">In spring, the bare tree branches come to life again with greenery. Seeds take root; vegetation and plants begin to grow; spring flowers emerge. Those animals that were hibernating will awaken and rely on some of the food they stored before hibernation to increase their body weight quickly. While spring officially starts on March 1, you can also answer the question 'when does spring start in Canada?' by observing the incredible change in climate and wildlife as spring begins.

<h3>autumn, season of the year between summer and winter during which temperatures gradually decrease. It is often called fall in the United States because leaves fall from the trees at that time. Autumn is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere as the period between the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length), September 22 or 23, and the winter solstice (year’s shortest day), December 21 or 22; and in the Southern Hemisphere as the period between March 20 or 21 and June 21 or 22.</h3>

<h4>Summer is the warmest season of the year. With our increased understanding of global warming and climate change, scientists are noticing that our summers are getting even hotter! Temperatures can hit record highs, and it’s not unusual to experience days, if not weeks, of 30°C!</h4>
